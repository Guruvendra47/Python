#  Python Assignment 2: Conditional Statements



##  Objective

To understand and apply Python conditional statements — **if**, **elif**, **else**, and **nested conditions** — through practical problems.



##  **Instructions**

1. 📝 Write Python code for each question in a new cell or file.  
2. 💬 Use proper comments to explain your logic.  
3. 🔍 Test your code with different inputs to verify correctness.  
4. 🚫 Avoid using libraries unless explicitly mentioned.  



## **Q1. Basic If-Else Check**

Write a Python program to check whether a given number is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**.



## **Q2. Even or Odd Number**

Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints whether it is **even** or **odd**.



## **Q3. Largest of Three Numbers (Using elif)**

Write a Python program to find the **largest** among three numbers using **if**, **elif**, and **else**.



## **Q4. Grade Calculator**

Write a Python program that accepts marks (0–100) and prints the **grade** based on the given conditions.



## **Q5. Leap Year Checker (Nested if)**

Write a program to check whether a given year is a **leap year** or not using **nested conditions**.



## **Q6. Nested Conditions – Eligibility Check**

Write a program to check if a person is:
