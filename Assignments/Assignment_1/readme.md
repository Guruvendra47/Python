# Python Assignment 1 — Variables, Data Types, Type Casting, Keywords & Literals

**Objective:**  
Practice and master Python fundamentals: variables, built-in data types, type casting (conversion), reserved keywords, and literals.  
This assignment progresses from basic checks to small programs that require combining concepts.

## 📘 Instructions
1. Create a new Python file or notebook for each question (or group related questions).  
2. Add clear comments explaining your logic.  
3. Include sample runs (input → output) for each program.  
4. Do not use external libraries unless a question explicitly allows it.  
5. For written/theory questions, answer succinctly and accurately.

---

## 📝 Q1. Basic: Variable Assignment
Assign values to variables (age, name, is_student, gpa, courses) and print their types using type().

---

## 📝 Q2. Data Types Identification (Short answers)
For each Python literal, state its data type:  
100, 3.14, 'c', 'Hello', True, None, (1,2,3), {'a':1}.

---

## 📝 Q3. Keywords Check
Import the keyword module and write a program that checks if a word is a Python keyword.

---

## 📝 Q4. Literals Classification
Given a literal as string input, classify it as Integer, Float, String, Boolean, None, or Other.

---

## 📝 Q5. Type Casting Basics
Demonstrate explicit casting between int, float, str, and bool with valid and invalid cases.

---

## 📝 Q6. Mixed Types Arithmetic
Perform addition based on input type: numeric addition or string concatenation.

---

## 📝 Q7. Temperature Converter
Convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit using user input and type conversion.

---

## 📝 Q8. Variables & Mutability
Explain mutable vs immutable with code showing list (mutable) and tuple (immutable) behavior.

---

## 📝 Q9. Input Validation (type casting + condition)
Take age as input, validate numeric, and classify into Child, Teenager, Adult, or Senior.

---

## 📝 Q10. Keywords & Identifiers
Explain valid Python identifiers and write code to check invalid ones or keywords.

---

## 📝 Q11. Advanced: Expression Parser
Accept simple expressions like '12 * 3.5' and evaluate using type casting and exception handling.
